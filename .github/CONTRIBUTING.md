In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity,
Micro Focus (US), Inc., its affiliates and subsidiaries ("Micro Focus")
must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor,
indicating agreement to the license terms.
This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Micro Focus and its users;
it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.
If you have not already done so, please complete and sign, then scan and email a pdf file of this Agreement to licensing@microfocus.com.

For complete details, refer to the [attached file](OpenSourceContributionAgreement1_0.pdf).
